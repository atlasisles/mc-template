For Atlas Isles

**Note: Designed to run on arm based systems**
Some features in our mc loaders require the use of Graal JVM runtime.

This repo doesn't contain the Dockerfile to run a basic Minecraft server. For that, take a look at itzg's [itzg/docker-minecraft-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) repository.
